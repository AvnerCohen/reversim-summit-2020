  "abstract": "You have a great idea for an app or an online service. You're going to be super rich and conquer the world, all the girls would want you and all the boys would want to be you, it's going to be so awesome and mom's going to be so proud, unless... someone have already done that before you.\n\nLet's face it - right now, while you're wasting time reading this blurb, it's either someone have already implemented your idea, or they are in the the final process of releasing it. That's why apps, and digital products in general, need to be built and out in the market fast. Like lightning fast.",
  "outline": "Slide 1: (1.5m)\nIt all start from an idea\nSo you have an idea for an app. And when I say an app I mean generally any online service. This is a great idea. Because it’s yours, right?\n\nSlide 2: (1.5m)\nHold your horses!\n\nHold your horses! We are not there yet. We are not scaling yet. We are bootstrapping, not even penetrating, just building skeletons and base concrete. And to be realistic here, someone probably already had this idea before you and he’s already in the middle of the implementation process. \n\nSlide 3: (1.5m)\nI’m Yonatan.\nNice to meet you.\n\nMy name is Yonatan. I am an entrepreneur, javascript developer, ux designer and a digital nomad. My recent experience with Spontix, a last minute events-tickets app, I co-founded, designed, built, launched and sold within a few month led me to make this talk.\n\nSlide 4: (1.5m)\nSo let’s look at what we have.\nAnd what we don’t.\n\nSo let’s see what we have. We an idea, which is great. Hopefully we also have some sort of market research and business model. Because to be brutally honest with you, if you haven’t done any of that your idea isn’t worth much.\n\nSo how do we make this idea become a real product?\n\nSlide 5: (2m)\nFocus on the M in MVP.\nThis is probably the best advice I can give you. Keep things minimal. It doesn't matter if you are the one who’s actually building it, or you have a technical co-founder, or you have an digital agency to craft the product for you - Development takes time.\nTherefor, take a good care white writing done requirement list and functionality for the app, then go over the list and remove 20-30% of the tasks you’ve listed. Then go to sleep, wake up in the morning, and wind up another 20-30%. The first version of your app should be light and lean, which lead me to the next point.\n\nSlide 6: (2m)\nMake things lean.\n\nThere’s so much been talked about lean startup philosophy and ways to implement it. For those who isn’t aware of it - it base on a circular model of - Build, Measure, Learn. First you build, then you measure if what you measured made sense you learn what you can do to improve and then build more based on the conclusions you’ve made.\nIf we take this into the scope of first version, keep in mind that every feature you build, might be obsolete after the first cycle - because it didn’t make sense product sense or didn’t drive traffic or what ever. Therefore - when you scope your first version - stick to the very base.\n\nSlide 7: (2m)\nDesign is everything.\n\nFocus on the flow and the UX, more than the UI. Get like a really good designer to look over your requirements list before starting any work. Good UX designer are able to look through logic and functionality from user perspective, and often they’ll tell you that you’re requirement document doesn’t make any sense. \nMake sure your design is modular and logic enough to be scaled up in time of need, which will save you a lot of time in the future, both for design and development.\n\nSlide 8: (3m)\nFocus on important tasks\nLet others do the rest.\n\nYou are probably short of resources and can’t do anything by yourself or by your small team. In order for you to focus on crafting a good product, try to figure out what do you need real team members and what could be done by an online service.\nI wouldn’t outsource core development or take a Fivrr designer. Because I think those two things relates directly to the product, and good product requires good and dedicated people. \nBut for stuff that are not directly connected to the core product, for example, paying a little bit extra to get devop configuration sorted out for server by a SaaS service - I would definitely use these kind of shortcuts.\n\nSlide 9: (1m)\nTo sum things up.\n\nMinimal - keep your scope to minimum.\nLean - grow fast and in small chunks.\nDesign - design before build\nPeople - people build product, all the rest is bonus.\n\n\nTotal Time: 15m",

But what do we do when reality forces us to adhere to some (Big Bad) Upfront Design?\n\nFor years, I thought the two are incompatible, but when forced with hard requirements I had to adapt, and accidentally stumbled upon an excellent way to combine the two, allowing us to quickly grow a team and parallelize work early and efficiently.\n\nThis talk is a case study of how we did that.

As the developers that we are, we decided to be agile in order to scale. Using scrum, we were able to scale to video content, producing events abroad, managing communities and meet-ups, collaborating with artists and creating unique products.

As heavy users of Aerospike & Clojure as our primary backend language, we needed to write a clj library for Aerospike as there wasn't anything readily available.  As part of its functionality we thought it would be useful for the library to encode and decode DB values to work with the diversity of serialization methods we use across our DBs (JSON, gzip, protobuf, etc).  However, we had a bit of an oversight in making the library non-blocking, and an even bigger mistake of having the wrong thread do the decoding.  All this created an extremely slow performance on high load of our production clients. We will dive into how we handled the issue rapidly in real time & the lessons learned.",

Empower developers and help them to write secure code. But how?\n- 7m security champions: Software developers from the entire organization who shows interests in security. They are responsible to improve the security of their teams, and being the local representative of the security team.\n- 7m security tests: Security tests helps developers detect security issues in their code. This section will focus on how to do security tests correctly so it will affect developers and help them. For example, tests that are not breaking the build are useless.\n- 7m continuous threat modeling: Threat modeling is a tool that helps us find security issues in the design. This part will include a really quick introduction and then cover how we can do threat modeling at scale\n3m - Conclusion.\nThe session will focus on the experience we gathered at Soluto.

I didn’t – until I started preparing a talk about how security tests can help people write more secure code. The point was to see how many vulnerabilities we can find by scanning a vulnerable application with security testing. But you’d be surprised to find out how many were actually detected.\nIn the session, we’ll find out how many security issues we can detect in OWASP Juice Shop by using various security tests.

While you may have a vision in mind, your colleagues might not see it clearly.\n\nIn this talk I'll share my story about moving Planck from a two-weeks version release to a CI/CD workflow. But it's not a talk about CI/CD (you've probably heard some of those already), it's a talk about being an entrepreneur inside your own organization - find your \"investors\", build the MVP, show results, overcome dogmas and so on...",
  "outline": "2m - intro\n2m - Background @ Outbrain where I \"soaked\" deep CI/CD culture and my early days @ Planck where I was frustrated about my team version-release (A.K.A promotion) process and my goal to change the dev org to work with CI/CD instead.\n2m - WIIFM - asking myself - does it make sense for Planck to do CI/CD? Am I not dogmatic myself for trying to push a process just because it worked well at Outbrain?\n5m - Understanding the resistance, the fears, etc... I will talk about how I tried, as the new guy, just to learn. I realized that CI/CD for an AI solution (with models that need to be tested for accuracy with each deploy -> which is expansive and long) is not as simple as I was used to. Then coming to the realization that it can be done and the problem is more cultural (fear of change) than technical\n\n5m - starting small:\n- Engaging the team - find champions (design-partners), repeat the \"mantra\" (in months from now  there won't be no promotion תגזרו from that to what we need now).\n- Overcoming the fear (the MVP): Creating a dev env with a CI/CD plan to staging (it's not production, what's the worst that could happen) -> Let's dry-run (נתאמן על יבש)\n\n5m - Find investors\n- After we've started small, now let's convince stakeholders - CTO, CEO, product\n- I'll share about our on-call routine in which everyday we've had a dev on-call. The dev on call had an ״עליית משמר\" and ״ירידת משמר\" where we gathered statistics about our problems such as: Dev time spent during the shift, dev time spend on/off-hours (after 19:00), MTTR, the severity of bugs and impact on customers etc...\n- The stats are meant to show the opportunity - the time wasted on promotion, on bugs that we can't fix until the next version and on customer requests that would have to wait until the next version.\n\n5m - Expand\n- After recuring the champions and the investors it's time to expand\n- Have a deep analysis on the on-call stats and reports -> Find out what's the ROI for fixing issues easily\n- Improve the system until.\n\n1m - Summary\nI will talk about becoming an intrapaneur, how to fight dogmas and change the culture to improve your organization. This will go through the main tips and tricks during the story and how to apply them on other projects, not necessarily CI/CD\n\n3m - Questions\n",

In this session I will review how we applied techniques such as sensitivity analysis, PDP & ICE, and LIME for explaining the predictions of generic, black-box models at Firefly.ai. Using two real-world use cases from the banking and real-estate industries, I will describe the pros and cons of each method, differences between the methods, and production considerations.",

To make this transition smoother, I propose to “transfer learn” machine learning jargon to management.\nIn this talk I’ll share a few machine learning concepts that can help you understand team behavior better and explain how to deal with the “dropout” of your team members and avoid “overfitting” your approach to team leadership.",

Fully connected layers are stronger now.\n-Back-Propagation\nWe learn a lot from mistakes, especially when we are their key contributors. We tend to underestimate learnings that are done by others.\n-Overfitting\nDeveloping a method its nice, but be careful about using same approach to all team members (best-recipe)\n-Pooling\nSometimes to analyze the picture you’ll need to deep-dive into edge cases (min/max pooling) and avoid looking at the average.\n\n",

We also wanted a way to dynamically turn on and off specific modules in the app (like all the features related to billing, or things related to sales). Breaking the monolith was necessary.\n- There are many options- there are many ways to break your web app; some of them are generics, and some of them are framework specific.\n- But before you choose a solution, know what you want to solve- don't try to solve ALL THE THINGS. For example, we know we don't need to support different frameworks since we are all working on React.\n- Choose the right solution for your needs- as said, there are many options out there: starting from arranging your code in some way, or using some tools like Lerna or Yarn Workspaces, or going all in and using a complete system that supports this, like Single-SPA or Web Components (or many things in between).\n- Tips to choose the right solution- the process we did and what helped us with the unknowns.",

Every decision and mostly implementation of new feature took a lot of time. \nThis had one main reason: The customer based grew rapidly. WhiteSource exists for more than 7 years now, but over the last year, it multiplied its number of customers. In addition to the number of customers, their size changed. From small Startups, mostly in Israel, we started to work with fortune 500 companies: from SAP to IBM to Oracle, and these are to name just a few. Since the system was growing so fast, there was never enough time to think thoroughly about the decisions that were made. This goes from engineering and architectural decisions, but mainly in the product area. \n\nWhy is it important for Product Manager and CEOs to understand the scaling challenge?\nHow do I convince my CEO/PM that these things are important. Product Managers don’t care about your architecture. However, they do care about the business value. They might not care if you use a Docker or a Monolith, but if there’s an outage every Friday night, they do care about it. When speaking to your PM or CEO, try to focus on business value. \n\nWhen working for fast-growing organizations, there’s always a tradeoff. If we take too much time thinking about each feature, interviewing hundreds of customers, we will never get to a point where we actually make the decision. However, often we focus on the first problem, and choose the best solution. \n\nSelling your product to customers is (sometimes) easy. The real challenge is the ongoing delivery, inventing the product each time and the long term relationship with our customers. \n",

  "title": "On demand testing environments",
  "type": "full",
  "abstract": "In the last few years, it became common practice for developers to have an end to end ownership on their features / services.\nNew tools and frameworks are required for enabling developers to develop, test, deploy, monitor their features, while keeping the development speed as is.\nOur R&D at taboola has more than 250 developers. They constantly push code and want to deploy their services to production. When I arrived to taboola, 2 years ago, one of the first things I noticed is how hard it was to test your service. It requires a new solution that would be dynamic, fast, UX friendly and easy to maintain.\nIn this talk I will present the on demand testing environment concept we built at taboola. with this framework, any developer can start a private environment for him to test in minutes.\n",
  "outline": "Definition and motivation\nWhat is a testing environment and why do we need it?\nIn large R&D groups with complex architecture, it’s hard for a developer to run a full or even a partial environment on his laptop. For example, we have a service that required multiple DBs from different kinds + 2 other taboola’s services. Each one of those components take a respectful size of resources. Starting it on your laptop might be possible, but it would work slow and you won’t be able to do much with it. A test environments allows you to build private testing environment of different kinds, depends on your requirements. With those environments you can:  \n\nTest your service manually\nTest your service automatically\nUse it for tutorials & hands-on\nUse it for demos\n\nI will describe the use cases of a testing environment \n\nOur solution\nAs taboola’s R&D grew dramatically, we required to have better tools for testing. The first thing I did was analyzing the developers requirements. I met with several developers from different groups, figured which are the most used services, what are the common cases that solving them would allow to break the bottleneck we had.\nNext, we built the solution. The idea was using a Jenkins job, where the developer choose his environment type and the job creates it for him. Behind the scene, there is a Jenkins groovy code that calculates the total required services (the asked services and their dependencies), and creates a nomad hcl file. Then nomad runs the job, creating docker containers on its different nodes, and Jenkins returns the environment details to the developer.\nIn the automation use case, we create an environment with multiple instances of the same service, so we can scale the tests and run them much faster. The improvement in times was drastic.\n\nIssues\nAs every new system we had some issues and we learned some important lessons:\nThe nomad cluster was not managed as a production service and that was wrong\nDocker storage driver caused a lot of issues at the beginning and we had to change it \nScaling the automation tests didn’t work on the first runs, containers crashed and we had to tune their resources to make it work\n\nFuture\nwhat improvements and changes we plan to do?\nAs a of our production services move to k8s, we plan to move that cluster as well.\nWhile using the environments, developers asked for new features, bug fixed , etc. we also plan to do those\nMake it a self service - today when a developer wants to make the environments support a new service, he needs to talk to the release engineering team. In the future we plan to make it a self service, the developer would need to do a simple action like filling a short form or commit a file, and his new service would be supported.\nTotal time: 30 minutes",

  "abstract": "Building a good services architecture is hard. Building a good services architecture aligned to an evolving business and a massive r&d growth is even a greater challenge.\nAs a R&D Director at Taboola, a super-growing company, I kept asking myself how to overcome this challenge. This is when I came across DDD and Event Storming and became passionate about it.\n\nDomain-Driven-Design, aka DDD, is a well known approach used by Netfix etc for designing complex software with alignment to the business. Event Storming is a tool for implementing this approach, mainly used in EU&US and not IL, at least till I give my talk:-)\n\nIn the talk I will explain how to visualize business flows using Event Storming,and how this visualization helps creating biz domain ownership in your engineering organization.

In this part I will  use a step-by-step example to explain all the ingredients for a successful Event Storming: \n * The setup - having the right participants, preparing the room (not a usual room)\n * The process itself - creating a colorful event driven flows using sticky notes.\n * Heuristics - do’s and dont’s for a successful session.\n\n-8m Benefits of Event Storming - This part will focus on using the outcome of the Event Storming for:\n * Discovering domains of your system - which will be used for building a business driven system.\n * Discovering the boundaries of the domains - which indicate the boundaries between r&d teams.\n * Discovering anomalies in your system - with Event Storming it is easy to find simple bottlenecks as well as problematic org structure affecting the system architecture (Conway’s Law).\n\n- 1m Q&A \n\nTotal:30 min\n",

This sucks. I decided to learn git from first principles.\n\nIn this session I will explain the git fundamentals: file structure, SHAs and objects, commits, refs and branches, up to the git interactive rebase. After this session, you should be able to understand git man pages, error messages, and repo states - without losing your HEAD.",
  "outline": "# Motivation\nI would like to create a good reference session in Hebrew about git, that can be used to explain the basics to developers in a meaningful and simple way. Most online sources today are either too long, assume outdated knowledge (e.g. \"unlike subversion, git uses...\"), and there's nearly nothing in Hebrew.\n\n# Structure\nThis session is going to be fast and technical. I am going to cover one concept after another, and use terms defined in previous slides. However, I am not going to assume any prior knowledge with git.\n\n# Tutorial\nIf time allows, I will create a sandbox tutorial repo that will enable developers to follow the session by practicing the actual commands covered on stage.\n\n# Outline\n* 1m Personal introduction\n* 2m Version control 101: Snapshots in time, sharing, telling a code story\n* 1m The problem: git is ubiquitous, but uses mysterious jargon. Understanding the basic concepts can help you understand any complicated git man page\n* 2m: git as a distributed system, stand-alone repos\n* 2m: Data storage: There's no DB. git stores data in files. The `.git` directory.\n* 5m SHAs: Files, Commits, Trees. The `git cat-file` command.\n* 7m The staging area: adding, reverting, resetting, checking out. Perhaps git stash.

The difference between low and high traffic varies up to 10X per geo and per data center.\nMoreover, we have ~250 developers that change the code on a daily basis.\nBreaking our SLA means Taboola is not serving recommendations - that’s obviously something we can’t afford. \n\nYou are invited to hear Taboola’s story of how we improved the way our services behave under extreme load, so we can avoid cascading service failures and we can fulfill the demands of the SLA.\n",

Who am I, what am I doing in Taboola?\n\n\n4m Our challenge:\nWe have 7 data-centers around the world. Each has peaks in traffic.  We have to keep our latencies low and service availability high. We are a growing company as more clients are being signed traffic increase.\nMoreover, more programmers are joining us all the time and our code base grows rapidly. We must have good monitoring on how long takes each stage in the processing of a request. And obviously, we control this.\nWe want to make sure our SLA and latency is low especially if some crisis goes on to avoid cascading service failures.\nPractical:\nEmphasizing the issue using numbers and graphs\n\n\n5m Analyzing the bottlenecks:\nOur main service has hundreds of threads. Few dozen are handling HTTP requests and the other threads are doing all kinds of stuff – Updating cache, send requests to other services etc. In order to have a clear picture of what exactly happens in the requests’ threads we develop the Tracing Context. It is a special mechanism that each developer can easily integrate into its code. The Tracing Context reports metrics about the time each stage in the request’s thread takes. This data is being reported to Grafana and Big Query and can be analyzed.

So we could move on to define a hard time limit for each of those culprits. We developed a mechanism we called Time Keeper.

However, once we had this mechanism we could easily make it more adaptive to the current situation of our servers. I will introduce the Load Indicator, a mechanism that calculating the current load on the server and define the budget of each feature respectively.\nPractical:\nShowing how Load Indicator identify load\nGiving a more practical example to use as adaptive server-side limits\n\n5m Using the Time Keeper to prioritize traffic\nDescribing how we are taking advantage of the Time Keeper when we don’t have any crisis going on. I will introduce how we are using the Time Keeper to give bigger time budgets to more important requests.\nPractical:\nDo you know what is your important traffic? \n\n2m Summary and what can you take of it\nSummary of the principals we learned during this process and what can be taken from this by others.\n\n2m Q&A\n\nTotal Time: 30m",

  "abstract": "Almost any application needs access to secrets. These secrets can be passwords, API keys, certificates and more.\nOver the years, the ways applications used secrets have evolved from keeping them hard-coded in the application, to external files and eventually to using a secrets manager. But every method has its pros and cons, mostly around simplicity vs security. This is where Secretless comes into play. The Secretless Broker lets your applications connect securely to services - without ever having to fetch or manage passwords or keys. So you get simplicity without compromising on security.\nIn this presentation, I will explain what is Secretless, how it works, why it’s good for security and simplicity, and how you can join this awesome project and become part of our community.",

  "outline": "This lecture has a 1-hour version. In addition to the slides on how the Insights engine works, I also give an intuitive explanation on how machines understand text, along with code examples showing how anyone can use these models in python (this was given as a lecture to our entire R&D).\n\nThe following is a 30-minute outline:\n\nOutline:\n1. Introduction (8 min.)\n1.1. Motivation: the benefits of understanding reviews (2 min.)\n1.2. The Insights engine and UI (2 min.)\n1.3. Cool success stories (2 min.)\n1.4. Algorithm overview: step 1: extract topics & opinions, step 2: analyze opinion sentiment, step 3: group similar topics & opinions (2 min.)\n\n2. A 10-minute tutorial on “how machine understands text” (actually, 12 min. :) )\n2.1. How do machines represent text: use vectors instead of IDs (3 min.)\n2.2. How do machines learn word representations: the Word2Vec approach - words are similar if they appear in similar contexts (3 min.)\n2.3. Different training data => different embeddings (2 min.)\n2.3. How do machines understand text: a quick overview of neural network models, that first learn a word embeddings and then learns how to combine them into a representation of the text (4 min.)\n\n3. How to analyze the sentiment of opinions? (10 min.)\n3.1. Problem definition of opinion sentiment analysis (2 min.)\n3.2. Why the trivial solution does not work (2 min.)\n3.3. Our approach (4 min.)\n3.4. Summary (2 min.)\n\n\nIf possible, I would be happy to give the full 1-hour talk.",

For them, it is a questionable science which they need to understand before trusting AI as part of their work.\nTo bridge this gap, we have decided to expose the internals of our core algorithm in a scientific publication, in Nature Medicine.\nI will discuss why choose this path, what alternatives were considered? What’s painful about exposing your IP to the world? How to bridge the worlds of academia and industry research, build the story, prepare the code and experiments, and what workarounds we found to address seemingly impossible technical requirements.

For example, we could optimize to generate an image that isn’t just classified as \"fox\" at 80% confidence, it’s 99.9% fox. For some reason, the result is not foxy at all, it’s a big pile of random noise pixels.

This led us to develop an in house Error Detector Mechanism, which is sensitive to the nature of our data.\n\nA development error can be DC specific, and peaks of errors can appear in certain rush hours of the day, certain days of the week, etc. Taking into account these factors, our constantly updating class-specific baselines can detect errors fast, with zero effect on performance, saving money and post mortem analysis effort. \n\nWe invite you to see how it is done at Taboola.",

I also go over common “data errors” such as date formatting, timezones etc.\n\n2.     Is it that time of year again? (2m)\nIn this section I cover daylight saving time and time changes and how errors caused by companies forgetting about it\n\n3.     AB test everything (including the test) (2m)\nI’ll talk about the why AB tests are awesome and guide lines and tips on how to run and test them.\n\n4.     Don’t get scared of a lot of data. (1m)\nwhat to do when you are not data savvy and got a lot of log / row data. Main point is not to panic, taking it bite-sized and following the next rules\n\n5.     Use whatever tool you want (2m)\nselecting the right tool for your analysis process, using something you are comfortable with, excel is a great tool I use but a developer might prefer Pyton or a data person SQL. The point is that at the first stages of an analysis, where you are still unsure what you are looking for exactly its more important to use a tool you already know and then switching to something you can replay and share (like a BI tool)\n\n6.     Pivot and breakdown (4m)\nhow to slice the data methodologically to find what you are looking for when investigating something. I show a clear example of a problem clearly seem when broken down by a specific dimension.\n\n7.     Always ask why (1m)\nthe importance as a data person to not just provide the answers but to truly understand the business / product question behind it. Just showing a trend and making it look like what we want is definitely not the way to be data-driven\n\n8.     Anything can influence your numbers (5m)\nI show an interesting example of an investigation I made while working at conduit, I had sporadically looking a drop in search data that I was trying to pin point its cause (so we can fix it).

I also explain the connection of holidays, big events or other reasons your website traffic or app usage might be affected by real world and unrelated reasons.\n\n9.     Think about it again in the shower (2m)\nwhat to do when you are stuck on a problem / analysis. My main point is to clear you head and talk to other people about it.

The Suspense API is in its early days, but will soon be used for data fetching, and the combination of the two will essentially make class components redundant.\nThis raises the question - how does React do that? How does it make the setState mechanism and lifecycle methods accessible without inheritance from React Component? And what does it actually mean that Suspense “suspends rendering”?

However, it works like a charm. \n\nIn this talk, I will show you how to combine few reliable open source technologies, get some help from their community, and after a month of no sleep, get the project running on massive scale successfully.

This is weird economic behavior.\n• 5m why you would want a project based on open source:\nWe took some risks on the way - we are talking about relaying on 5 open sources that are the majority of the application code, while the main source, Debezium, was an opensource that didn’t even celebrate his first birthday yet. \nThe integration of so many open sources wasn’t easy, but at the end the benefit is clear- short dev time, robust and fault tolerant application that runs on huge scale. About 600 different data sources and millions of events per second.\nWhile every company nowadays needs its own data streaming application, how many software companies can make the necessary investment of let’s say 5 development teams and a year of work, needed to create this kind of project? The answer is quite clear... \nMost of the companies want and need these projects - but not at any cost, and that’s why all of you can benefit from our experience.\n• 15m Our solution:\n• Our solution + Architectural overview: \nChallenge - moving huge data sets in real time from hundreds of OLTP databases into a powerful in memory DB that can handle analysis at scale. \nSolution - Using change data capture (CDC) design patterns to identify every change being made in our  databases and writing it to Kafka as a shared resource\nArchitecture challenges - \nScale -hundreds of Databases and billions of events being processed on each single database. Horizontal scalability was achieved by isolating each CDC agent to work independently across many servers.\nMaintainability - Having different CDC agents for every single DB for hundreds of instances can be a challenging task when you need to maintain it. So we dockerized the environment and allowed Kubernetes to carry on the burden.\n•  Scale overview : facts about our scale - hundreds of data sources (600), millions of events per second, how we managed to scale up the project.\n• Open source community help: how the open source communities helped and accompanied us in every step.\n• 3m Q&A\nTotal time: 30m\n",

It’s time to try a new approach – one that enables you to handle blockers, stay focused, boost your creativity, and increase your delivery speed.\n\nIn the latest product we’ve been working on at Soluto, we decided to try a new method that calls for non-traditional steps to achieve our desired product.

We did the opposite – defined the deadline (2 months) and then defined the scope. It forced us to think on a small yet real and valuable MVP, be super focused and efficient.\n\n\n\n-          Usually you start with some research (target audience, competitors, etc.) and then start brainstorming your product. We decided we’re not waiting for results, and in parallel started testing different value propositions (for example using landing pages). I'll share our ways to quickly test actual product offerings – to speed up the process and identify opportunities.\n\n\n\n-          Usually features prioritization is based on feasibility (technical complexity), user value, business value (profitability), etc.. As we’re talking specifically on the earliest stage of the product (as it’s new), we decided to add another criteria – how much each feature “explains” where this product is heading. I’ll share our examples for features that better deliver the overall product and potential value (and explain why).\n\n\n\n8m Key take-aways for every B2B and B2C product development\n\nKey take-aways I’ll share will be based on the steps we took and our learning – how anyone can take from them something that is relevant for him/her. For example (compatible to the example steps shared above) -\n\n\n\n-          Set reasonable yet close deadline to create the right focus, even before determining the scope.\n\nMany times PMs, developers and UXs find themselves working on features or products for months that don’t necessarily go live. It’s been too long and no longer relevant, there are other business opportunities, market needs changed, etc.\n\nStarting by defining a deadline helps you “pour” into it a focused scope, cleaning the backlog from anything that is not impactful or critical for the launch.\n\n\n\n-          Start from pure value. Ignore the rest.\n\nTest your ideas and value propositions as soon as possible on real users. In order to nail down the new product, put aside the work on the homepage, marketing, pricing, etc. and focus on the actual value (Great tools to do so for example are landing pages and surveys).\n\n\n\n-          Choose the features that clarify where your product is heading.\n\nAs we all want to start small and fast (quickly learn, minimize risk, etc.) – there’s a concern users will miss the overall offering of the product. Selecting the right features to start with is crucial for that. It should be features that help users understand how this product is going to help them with X, even if it's not actually doing it yet. \n\n3m Summary\n\n \n\n",

  "type": "full",
  "abstract": "While Deep Learning (DL) is proven effective black box, without the ability to peek into the inner workings of our model, to understand and guide the learning process, we quickly reach a glass ceiling.\n\nWe tackle this with an adversarial game: A DL model that learns  DL! \nWhile it can be generalized, we'll focus on NLP: Given an RNN that learns to embed text, we introduce an \"Editor\" model - by observing the  RNN’s hidden states (without access to the input text) it predicts how editing each word will affect the RNN’s performances - forcing it to analyze the RNN’s perception of language and guide it’s learning process.\n\nWe'll demonstrate the Editor as a highly effective analytical tool that reveals crucial patterns in our model's behavior, dataset and dramatically improve generalization.",
  "outline": "2m Introduction: A little bit about myself and and my professional background\n\n2m Defining the Problem: Why do we need to look inside the black box even if our model yields great results on our test sets (with some concrete examples)\n\n3m Solution Overview:  An adversarial game between two players: An RNN that learns to read text in order to reduce some loss and an Editor that tries to increase the same loss by words editing. When the Editor edits a word, it replaces it by a token (‘edit’) and receives a penalty. Hence, the Editor needs to detect the most important words for the RNN in order to minimize the penalty. Note that the Editor's inputs are the RNN's hidden states, thus, it acts as a Deep Learning framework that learns machine learning. At the same time the RNN needs to utilize both syntax and semantics to compensate the missing information.\n\n10m The Solution: Our reinforcement framework for the adversarial game\n\n8m Experiments:  We use the editor both as a pure analytical tool (that is, without interfering the RNN’s training) and for boosting the RNN’s performances. We show our results for grounding textual phrases in images, where we are asked to find an object in an image based on a referential phrase.  This task offers a very intuitive way for us to understand how important each word is. While we observe a huge overfit, we see a dramatic reduction in overfit with the aid of the Editor. As an analytical tool, the Editor points us to a surprising pattern in the RNN’s behavior and a destructive bias in our dataset. \n\n5m Q&A\n",

  "abstract": "Only half of a mobile app's users use it more than once. Maybe they just got what they needed, but often they leave because they’re overwhelmed, not sure what to do or think they can’t get what they came for.\n\n\nGood onboarding and introduction can drastically improve this, but it’s not easy to make it work for everyone. Some users like to be guided and hand-held, while others just want to explore. How can we support both types of beginners? Can we avoid a Clippy situation, an onboarding process that detracts more than it helps?\n\n\nI spent 2 years at the MIT Media Lab investigating how to make it easier for kids to get started with Scratch, a coding environment for kids. In this talk I’ll share some key points learned along the way and demonstrate how to apply them in any onboarding process.",
  "outline": "* Intro - My name and some context: worked on the Scratch team, researched onboarding in online, creative learning tools at the MIT Media Lab.\n* The first thing I learned about onboarding: It’s harder than it looks! You need a lot of user testing and iterations, and things are not always as easy as they seem.\n* Our “mantra” for tools: Low floors, high ceiling, wide walls (easy to get started with, you can create very complex things, and it supports a variety of topics). \n* But how do you lower the floors, without lowering the ceiling and narrowing the walls?\nTo try to answer that, I created Scratch Microworlds which are simplified versions of Scratch, meant to help learners get started and make onboarding easier. \n* But I believe our insights are relevant for other tools as well…\n* We simplified - \n** Choosing few coding blocks (but not too few) - hiding elements can help reduce cognitive load. \n** Choosing ones that are simple, yet versatile and showcase what you can do - From ** “hello world” to “holy cow”.\n** Our goal was supporting creativity, but in other tools it could be functionality/user goals. \n* We scaffolded -\n** Scaffolding is creating a process you go through and learn a bit every time. \n** Avoid clippy situation! Nobody wants help that’s not helpful... \n** Knowing exactly what people want is really hard - instead, give them agency to explore on their own! \n** Users decide when to move forward\n** Users decide where to go next - give options, not instructions.\n* We motivated - \n** Help users answer the question - why should I even try this tool? \n** Show them what’s possible - there are many possible ways - intro video,  project gallery, tutorials. \n** We created a set of activities, each around a topics of interest, and made sure each showcases different aspects of things you can do. \n** Other products need to match the way they present possibilities to users with their product. \n* To sum it up, onboarding is not just helping your users know which button to click when, it’s also a way to communicate your values, show what it possible, and help users expand their understanding. It’s not an easy task, but when it works, it’s magical :) \n",

  "abstract": "When Python 3 was released over a decade ago, it was slow and missing important features, in addition to being non-backwards-compatible. It took many years until the issues were resolved and most libraries added support for Python 3. Soon, Python 2 will finally reach the end of its life: when 2020 arrives, Python 2 will no longer be supported.\n\nThe amount of Python 2 code still in use is enormous! Many projects and organizations now clearly need to port their codebases to Python 3, but this is a non-trivial task which is usually met with anxiety.\n\nI'll tell how I ported a large, monolithic codebase from Python 2 to 3, which approach and tools I used, and what I learned in the process. This should give a good idea of what such an upgrade entails and how it may be approached.",

Optimization is at the heart of this, since the goal is to find fuzzy matches efficiently.\n\nI will describe varied optimization techniques, from low-level bit fiddling in C extensions written manually and with Cython, up to analyzing the problem domain and reducing the search space.

  "title": "From backend to hundreds of servers in (a few) seconds",
  "type": "full",
  "abstract": "Taboola services rely heavily on having fresh data. Whether it's campaigns related data, configurations or kill-switches. relevant information must propagate fast reliably way to all services.\ndelivering fresh information across ~700 frontend servers, spreading over 7 time-zones means you always fight the endless battle of how fresh is your data the load you create by fetching that data. With frontend servers handling over 500k HTTP requests p/s we have very little resources to spare.\nAs we continue to grow we find ourselves tweaking caches frequently.so we decided to take another path. \nJoin us to hear how we leveraged MySql replication with our Kafka know-how. Achieving near real-time data injection from our backend db to ALL services within seconds, with very little load on the services",
  "outline": "2m : introduction about Taboola and the scale + my position @ Taboola\n\n7 min : Presenting taboola’s conventional way of  metadata at scale :\nWe use Mysql as a metadata db, with centralized master DB residing within our backend data center. Master db have slaves containing a replicated copy of parts of the data. The replicated dbs spread across the remote data centers. Updates/inserts/deletes are performed only on the master db - ensuring consistency. Reads can be made from any slave or master if it is crucial getting the most up to date data.\n\nWe use a few levels of caching above mysql data:\nMemcached - keeping projected values of mysql row data\nLocal Key-Value store (AKA Updatable cache) : Data is loaded on demand, Has various expiration and eviction policies, Can (and 99% of the time) update expired key on the background\nLocal machine bulk cache: Loading data periodically from mysql, Reads from it cannot trigger a fetch from the db\n5 min : Talking about the issues\nWhy Taboola needs fresh metadata so badly:\nClosed/Stopped campaigns are still presented, causing Taboola to lose money\nOn a large scale system a broken feature flag could cause massive damage, in a matter of minutes if not closed. An extreme issue we had was a new feature that caused such a load on the DB that we got timeouts on reading the configuration that was supposed to close it. Being unable to close the killswitch we had to restart a major part of the frontend services\n(Near) Real-time controlling of computational “expansive” features across an entire DC - depending on traffic\nLoad on services:\nUpdating caches on a high scale service is a complicated task. On one side you want to keep the cached value for as little as possible. And on the other hand you want to reduce the load on the service and on the DB. For example : Taboola’s campaigns cache, has sparse data. raising its TTL of the cache to 10 times of its current value reduces the load by 10% on the FE service!\nAs a result of trying to reduce the load we often need to increase cache TTLs. causing an inherent delay in getting fresh data\nReplication delays: Not all db changes need to propagate fast. Since mysql cannot defer between them a very large amount of updates can cause a replication delay, on all data. Even though we do not mind about getting the overloading data in a delay\nTransparency - or the lack of it : You cannot measure on delay of data per table (arrival time of data to the slave - row change/insert/delete time on the master)\n\n3 min : Mysql master-slave quick overview:\nA short inroduction about what is MySql binlog\n10 min : The solution\nBreaking the conventional pattern - bypassing mysql replication: \nA Service listening on master-db binlog file, batching the changes writing it encoded to Kafka on a dedicated topic (protobuff)\nMirroning the messages from the backend kafka to all Frontend kafkas\nConsuming the messages from within the service\n“Injecting” the change directly to the cache\nRaising the TTL of connected caches - reducing the load\nWhy did we choose to go that way ?\nDB changes on master-db can come from a large number of points including manual queries. There is no single point in which we could plant a code that sends the data to kafka. We have to “hack” the db for that\nWe already use kafka to transfer huge amounts of data, we have confidence that we can transfer the data with very low latency and no data loss\nA single consumer load the server a lot less resources than multiple background threads updating the caches\nWe get a total delay of less than 4 seconds between the time of change in the db until ALL FE services update the cache (P99)\nShowing some graphs of real-time data metrics\n3 min : Conclusions and Takes\nWhen should you use it ? this solution has a lot of moving parts, it's here to solve a scale issue caused by reading sparse data from mysql on a busy server. It has a lot of risks but on critical data that freshness is super important, the reward is huge! \nNow that we have all master-db data streamed we can leverage it to more stuff other than service caches - near real-time analysis \nQ&A \n",

  "abstract": "Don't you just love creating a good, elegant, juicy abstraction? Extracting the ESSENCE of a problem. Coming up with generalizations. Debating their relative merits of a on social media. It's all so much more fun than solving these pesky bugs that keep coming back from QA. \nWe are developers, dammit! Abstractions are what we do!\n \nOn our day-to-day, we often don't think about the level of abstraction we employ to solve a problem, or how the abstractions we choose affect the kind of solutions we reach. But what if we could think abstractly about abstract thinking? Let's explore the ways the mental model of the ladder of abstraction can help us choose our career path, solve problems, deliver clearer messages and help others grow.\n \nvery meta. so philosophy. much recursion. wow.",
