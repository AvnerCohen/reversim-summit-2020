We were able to overcome those and build a successful and scalable off-shore team. \nIn my presentation, I would share the know-hows and key factors for building a successful off-shore team.","outline":"* WalkMe intro\n* Why offshore?\n* Why Ukraine?\n* * Technology\n* * Soft Skills\n* * Costs\n* The offshore company (optional)\n* * Advantages compared to direct hiring\n* * Hiring abilities\n* * Candidates’ job security\n* * Logistics\n* Hiring process\n* * Important requirements\n* * Team roles and structure\n* * Compromise about not important things.\n* Running the team\n* * Company branding\n* * Expectations and growth plan\n* * 1:1 meetings\n* * Communication methods \n* * Code quality\n* * Integrations with the other R\u0026D teams\n* * Benefits and retention\n","legal":true,"created_at":{"$date":"2018-05-08T11:55:12.158Z"},"updated_at":{"$date":"2018-05-08T11:55:12.158Z"},"status":"proposed","categories":["Culture"],"tags":["Management","Hiring","Culture"],"comments":[],"attendees":[{"$oid":"5af09ca00c482c0014ab514f"},{"$oid":"5b11348dbba1a90014b9c0c6"},{"$oid":"5b0baa5592ac8b0014779700"},{"$oid":"5b114feabba1a90014b9c0ea"},{"$oid":"5b117474bba1a90014b9c116"},{"$oid":"5ae18ecb7441e10014ab4a3a"},{"$oid":"5ae491a54d69640014d96a80"},{"$oid":"5b1390d57763d60014e5e9d3"},{"$oid":"5af94ca0b5d55a001446ce84"},{"$oid":"5ae5c70b91bdf000143bde8f"},{"$oid":"5b13a7dc2f70680014eee83d"},{"$oid":"5b13a9022f70680014eee84a"},{"$oid":"5b13a7e12f70680014eee83e"},{"$oid":"5b13a24a2f70680014eee823"},{"$oid":"5b13aa7269fe6400146c244d"},{"$oid":"5b13ad8c69fe6400146c245e"},{"$oid":"5b13aef369fe6400146c2464"},{"$oid":"5b0263c75d1a1000140c59b1"},{"$oid":"5b0fbfcd892ac300148168f5"},{"$oid":"5b13d93a69fe6400146c2550"},{"$oid":"5b0a8bda92ac8b00147796e0"},{"$oid":"5b13e91269fe6400146c2597"},{"$oid":"5b0eabba2743a60014eeb403"},{"$oid":"5b14e9e169fe6400146c267c"},{"$oid":"5b14edb969fe6400146c2688"},{"$oid":"5b14edf869fe6400146c268a"},{"$oid":"5b14edf769fe6400146c2689"},{"$oid":"5b14ee3869fe6400146c268b"},{"$oid":"5b15433dc6fa1800145b0869"},{"$oid":"5b0da5f44b330d00147e3387"},{"$oid":"5b154b09c6fa1800145b087c"},{"$oid":"5b154cb3c6fa1800145b087d"},{"$oid":"5b15b465c6fa1800145b08ee"},{"$oid":"5b1699f8c740cb0014f8a8e0"},{"$oid":"5b16927cc740cb0014f8a8de"},{"$oid":"5b1bd0ba9d95680014f7cf0e"},{"$oid":"5b026f8e5d1a1000140c59b2"}],"speaker_ids":[{"$oid":"5af161bd4ff5eb00144ee541"}],"__v":0}

Such an approach also requires patience and trust in a process that takes time to lead to a mature product.","outline":"• 2m Introduction: Who am I and my professional background\n• 8m What is Soluto all about - background, industry, working methods\n• 10m The problem we reinvented and the opportunities it unfolded\n• 10m The obstacles we had in our way and how we tackled them\n• 5m Q\u0026A\nTotal time: 35m","legal":true,"created_at":{"$date":"2018-05-14T15:53:08.382Z"},"updated_at":{"$date":"2018-05-16T08:19:37.856Z"},"status":"proposed","categories":["Customer","Backend"],"tags":["Product","Culture","Management"],"comments":[],"attendees":[{"$oid":"5af86b69b5d55a001446ce79"},{"$oid":"5b0fef33892ac30014816915"},{"$oid":"5b115196bba1a90014b9c0ec"},{"$oid":"5b11600cbba1a90014b9c0f7"},{"$oid":"5b117e9ebba1a90014b9c11e"},{"$oid":"5b0e98562743a60014eeb3f7"},{"$oid":"5b027a935d1a1000140c59b3"},{"$oid":"5b03b67b5a9f82001487a3ef"},{"$oid":"5b13982a7763d60014e5e9f6"},{"$oid":"5b13987c7763d60014e5e9fa"},{"$oid":"5b1399067763d60014e5ea00"},{"$oid":"5b1399b27763d60014e5ea05"},{"$oid":"5b1399aa7763d60014e5ea04"},{"$oid":"5b139a7b7763d60014e5ea0d"},{"$oid":"5b139af37763d60014e5ea0e"},{"$oid":"5b139b0b7763d60014e5ea0f"},{"$oid":"5b139b877763d60014e5ea15"},{"$oid":"5b139d172f70680014eee806"},{"$oid":"5b113826bba1a90014b9c0cb"},{"$oid":"5b139e462f70680014eee812"},{"$oid":"5b139dd62f70680014eee80d"},{"$oid":"5b139fa92f70680014eee818"},{"$oid":"5b1398657763d60014e5e9f8"},{"$oid":"5b13a3642f70680014eee825"},{"$oid":"5b137fbd38213e0014d1d0ca"},{"$oid":"5b13a70f2f70680014eee839"},{"$oid":"5b13a82a2f70680014eee840"},{"$oid":"5b13a82e2f70680014eee842"},{"$oid":"5b13abe569fe6400146c2454"},{"$oid":"5b0a348536e9e10014ced47d"},{"$oid":"5b13bce669fe6400146c24ab"},{"$oid":"5b13be9a69fe6400146c24b2"},{"$oid":"5b13c05269fe6400146c24b7"},{"$oid":"5b13c9c669fe6400146c2503"},{"$oid":"5b13ce4869fe6400146c2521"},{"$oid":"5b13d42569fe6400146c253c"},{"$oid":"5b0fb78c892ac300148168f3"},{"$oid":"5b13d76169fe6400146c2546"},{"$oid":"5b13e71969fe6400146c258f"},{"$oid":"5b13eeca69fe6400146c25a0"},{"$oid":"5b1407ad69fe6400146c25dd"},{"$oid":"5b0283305d1a1000140c59b4"},{"$oid":"5b0ead902743a60014eeb405"},{"$oid":"5b14c24269fe6400146c2636"},{"$oid":"5af8725fb5d55a001446ce7a"},{"$oid":"5b150180c6fa1800145b07d8"},{"$oid":"5b15019bc6fa1800145b07d9"},{"$oid":"5b15022ac6fa1800145b07dc"},{"$oid":"5b1512fcc6fa1800145b0808"},{"$oid":"5b159990c6fa1800145b08d8"},{"$oid":"5b159dafc6fa1800145b08db"},{"$oid":"5b15b0c0c6fa1800145b08ec"},{"$oid":"5b15cc4bc6fa1800145b08fa"},{"$oid":"5b16648ac740cb0014f8a8c3"},{"$oid":"5b16c8cfc740cb0014f8a8f2"},{"$oid":"5b1790cac740cb0014f8a92d"},{"$oid":"5b17db988f4d6f00146126f5"},{"$oid":"5b18dbc88f4d6f0014612798"},{"$oid":"5b18ed018f4d6f00146127b9"},{"$oid":"5b1929152cd4b70014392180"},{"$oid":"5b12ddce38213e0014d1d08d"},{"$oid":"5b026f8e5d1a1000140c59b2"}],"speaker_ids":[{"$oid":"5af70242cb1fea0014992e90"}],"__v":0}

In this talk I will share my experience with this research problem, the unique challenges it can tackle and a use-case of my plan recognition work with a major financial company.","outline":"• 2m Introduction: Who am I and my professional background\n• 3m Motivation: Why machine learning can't solve all AI challenges\n• 5m Solution: What is plan recognition and what it can do\n• 10m Overview of current approaches for performing plan recognition\n• 5m Use case: A collaboration with a major financial company\n• 5m Q\u0026A\nTotal time: 30m","legal":true,"created_at":{"$date":"2018-05-15T19:35:05.435Z"},"updated_at":{"$date":"2018-05-17T18:48:46.995Z"},"status":"proposed","categories":["Artificial Intelligence"],"tags":["Algorithms","Planning","Artificial Intelligence"],"comments":[],"attendees":[{"$oid":"5af09ca00c482c0014ab514f"},{"$oid":"5b11376bbba1a90014b9c0ca"},{"$oid":"5b113662bba1a90014b9c0c8"},{"$oid":"5ae0c3c865b29100146c5969"},{"$oid":"5af011e50c482c0014ab5145"},{"$oid":"5b11aa89bba1a90014b9c133"},{"$oid":"5b11bbce37bc6300142f6935"},{"$oid":"5b123c6e38213e0014d1d009"},{"$oid":"5adc3c179bd58800140f1dee"},{"$oid":"5b102b0d892ac30014816943"},{"$oid":"5affd708d122e50014f3f44a"},{"$oid":"5ae0eea865b29100146c5970"},{"$oid":"5b126cfb38213e0014d1d027"},{"$oid":"5b129e8238213e0014d1d048"},{"$oid":"5b126d0a38213e0014d1d028"},{"$oid":"5b12d38138213e0014d1d077"},{"$oid":"5b12d06338213e0014d1d076"},{"$oid":"5b12db6838213e0014d1d088"},{"$oid":"5b127e4438213e0014d1d037"},{"$oid":"5b12ddce38213e0014d1d08d"},{"$oid":"5b1311bc38213e0014d1d0ae"},{"$oid":"5b124ae738213e0014d1d00e"},{"$oid":"5adf6ea512c4650014220ee3"},{"$oid":"5af9c96784356a0014d61b14"},{"$oid":"5b13a9022f70680014eee84a"},{"$oid":"5b13aa4269fe6400146c244a"},{"$oid":"5b1396fa7763d60014e5e9ec"},{"$oid":"5b13d38f69fe6400146c253a"},{"$oid":"5b1402de69fe6400146c25d5"},{"$oid":"5b113dafbba1a90014b9c0d7"},{"$oid":"5b14551969fe6400146c261f"},{"$oid":"5b14d80769fe6400146c264c"},{"$oid":"5b14e71169fe6400146c2672"},{"$oid":"5b146c0f69fe6400146c262c"},{"$oid":"5b01b677ea92090014a196cf"},{"$oid":"5b15456ec6fa1800145b086b"},{"$oid":"5afa812984356a0014d61b17"},{"$oid":"5b10425b892ac30014816956"},{"$oid":"5af763d3fd57240014163a2b"},{"$oid":"5b0fae29892ac300148168e7"},{"$oid":"5b129b5e38213e0014d1d045"},{"$oid":"5acc6333fe5562001493c9e2"},{"$oid":"5b1bfe5a9d95680014f7cf12"},{"$oid":"5b1caf4e9d95680014f7cf23"},{"$oid":"5b1cffabeaf1f300145a5920"}],"speaker_ids":[{"$oid":"5af89196b5d55a001446ce7e"}],"__v":0}

Our open source project focuses on viewing Java threads \"flames\", showing how we can visualise heap allocations and most challenging, exploring how to visualise progress in a flame graph via animations. For example, we can now see for the first time how a JVM starts interpreting code, compiling hot paths via JIT compilation, executing them and collecting garbage.

Hopefully, after this session you will fell more comfortable and confident to take those tasks !","outline":"2m - Introduction - Who am I\n2m - Agenda\n10m - Best strategies to break legacy code and stay alive\n10m - Lets talk about reverse engineering\n3m - Summary\n","legal":true,"created_at":{"$date":"2018-05-22T14:37:05.727Z"},"updated_at":{"$date":"2018-05-22T14:37:05.727Z"},"status":"proposed","categories":["Backend"],"tags":["Infrastructure","Backend"],"comments":[],"attendees":[{"$oid":"5ae99d6fad72ec001497f4d6"},{"$oid":"5b11348dbba1a90014b9c0c6"},{"$oid":"5adc3c179bd58800140f1dee"},{"$oid":"5aed91ab8ef0e50014913278"},{"$oid":"5aeaa00d65b6d50014d069bc"},{"$oid":"5b117474bba1a90014b9c116"},{"$oid":"5ae0c3c865b29100146c5969"},{"$oid":"5af011e50c482c0014ab5145"},{"$oid":"5b11839fbba1a90014b9c122"},{"$oid":"5b102b0d892ac30014816943"},{"$oid":"5b123c6e38213e0014d1d009"},{"$oid":"5b124ae738213e0014d1d00e"},{"$oid":"5b117e9ebba1a90014b9c11e"},{"$oid":"5adef10d12c4650014220ee0"},{"$oid":"5b11324bbba1a90014b9c0bf"},{"$oid":"5b0427a45a9f82001487a3f6"},{"$oid":"5b127e4438213e0014d1d037"},{"$oid":"5b129e8238213e0014d1d048"},{"$oid":"5b12a49a38213e0014d1d04e"},{"$oid":"5b12bb7638213e0014d1d064"},{"$oid":"5b12d06338213e0014d1d076"},{"$oid":"5b12da2f38213e0014d1d084"},{"$oid":"5b12e1d138213e0014d1d091"},{"$oid":"5b138c4238213e0014d1d0fc"},{"$oid":"5b13aa4269fe6400146c244a"},{"$oid":"5aef024e7b81dc001438ba55"},{"$oid":"5b13cc8c69fe6400146c2514"},{"$oid":"5b13d38f69fe6400146c253a"},{"$oid":"5b13cbf369fe6400146c2510"},{"$oid":"5b13175638213e0014d1d0b0"},{"$oid":"5b13dfc469fe6400146c2573"},{"$oid":"5b13e02469fe6400146c2576"},{"$oid":"5b13e20169fe6400146c257e"},{"$oid":"5afc06180a08500014436137"},{"$oid":"5b12bb3f38213e0014d1d063"},{"$oid":"5b13fd3669fe6400146c25c2"},{"$oid":"5b113dafbba1a90014b9c0d7"},{"$oid":"5b14d80769fe6400146c264c"},{"$oid":"5b14e31d69fe6400146c2665"},{"$oid":"5b150f0ac6fa1800145b0800"},{"$oid":"5b152806c6fa1800145b083d"},{"$oid":"5b146c0f69fe6400146c262c"},{"$oid":"5b1553ffc6fa1800145b088f"},{"$oid":"5afa812984356a0014d61b17"},{"$oid":"5b159209c6fa1800145b08c8"},{"$oid":"5b164441c6fa1800145b0933"},{"$oid":"5b1645acc6fa1800145b0939"},{"$oid":"5b16461ec6fa1800145b093a"},{"$oid":"5b0d92a94b330d00147e3381"},{"$oid":"5b129b5e38213e0014d1d045"},{"$oid":"5afd2f8b6555a80014e7e0a5"},{"$oid":"5b184e7e8f4d6f0014612777"},{"$oid":"5b18df6d8f4d6f001461279f"},{"$oid":"5b14f1df69fe6400146c2693"},{"$oid":"5b1974202cd4b70014392196"},{"$oid":"5b12ddce38213e0014d1d08d"},{"$oid":"5b1a9fce238ef1001448aeeb"},{"$oid":"5b1ac992238ef1001448aefd"},{"$oid":"5b1ace65238ef1001448aeff"},{"$oid":"5b1d869beaf1f300145a5943"}],"speaker_ids":[{"$oid":"5b0427a45a9f82001487a3f6"}],"__v":0}

I will show how new architecture is designed to address the challenge of achieving dev teams autonomy. I will also show how we implement the new architecture by moving from a traditional centralised database approach to Event Sourcing using streams of changes as a source of truth.","outline":"• 2m Introduction: Who am I and my professional background\n• 5m Architectural overview: how we utilise micro services, and why we ended up having service per feature architecture.\n• 5m Data dichotomy problem leading to inter team dependencies. \n• 15m Our solution: Utilising event sourcing using streams of changes to achieve teams decoupling and domains isolation.\n• 5m Q\u0026A\nTotal time: 32 min\n","legal":true,"created_at":{"$date":"2018-05-23T10:01:41.055Z"},"updated_at":{"$date":"2018-05-23T10:01:41.055Z"},"status":"proposed","categories":["Programming","Backend"],"tags":["Infrastructure","Event Sourcing","Domain Driven Development"],"comments":[],"attendees":[{"$oid":"5b0fef33892ac30014816915"},{"$oid":"5b115334bba1a90014b9c0ed"},{"$oid":"5b11b82837bc6300142f6933"},{"$oid":"5b1231a837bc6300142f6947"},{"$oid":"5ae0eea865b29100146c5970"},{"$oid":"5ae1a93a30c592001426af87"},{"$oid":"5b0e98562743a60014eeb3f7"},{"$oid":"5b116c38bba1a90014b9c109"},{"$oid":"5b113152bba1a90014b9c0be"},{"$oid":"5b138aba38213e0014d1d0f3"},{"$oid":"5af8810cb5d55a001446ce7d"},{"$oid":"5b0263c75d1a1000140c59b1"},{"$oid":"5b114109bba1a90014b9c0db"},{"$oid":"5afe5cb36da2a500140d899b"},{"$oid":"5b1557d8c6fa1800145b0896"},{"$oid":"5b15a200c6fa1800145b08e1"},{"$oid":"5b12ddce38213e0014d1d08d"},{"$oid":"5b17ee0c8f4d6f001461271e"},{"$oid":"5ae59df991bdf000143bde8b"},{"$oid":"5b17f17f8f4d6f0014612720"},{"$oid":"5b17f19a8f4d6f0014612721"},{"$oid":"5b17f3968f4d6f0014612726"},{"$oid":"5b17f6098f4d6f0014612728"},{"$oid":"5b17f67e8f4d6f0014612729"},{"$oid":"5b17f8378f4d6f001461272b"},{"$oid":"5b17fa488f4d6f001461272c"},{"$oid":"5b180e788f4d6f0014612731"},{"$oid":"5b1813ea8f4d6f0014612736"},{"$oid":"5b1831528f4d6f0014612765"},{"$oid":"5b18451a8f4d6f0014612775"},{"$oid":"5b18df408f4d6f001461279e"},{"$oid":"5b18e7fa8f4d6f00146127ad"},{"$oid":"5b18ea128f4d6f00146127b4"},{"$oid":"5b1a23462cd4b700143921aa"},{"$oid":"5afda8ba6555a80014e7e0af"},{"$oid":"5b1bc8339d95680014f7cf0d"},{"$oid":"5b1cccc19d95680014f7cf33"},{"$oid":"5b1ccdbe9d95680014f7cf34"},{"$oid":"5b1cd4669d95680014f7cf39"},{"$oid":"5b1cd6119d95680014f7cf3b"},{"$oid":"5b1cd6119d95680014f7cf3c"},{"$oid":"5b1cd6109d95680014f7cf3a"},{"$oid":"5b1cd61c9d95680014f7cf40"},{"$oid":"5b1cd6159d95680014f7cf3d"},{"$oid":"5b1cd6179d95680014f7cf3e"},{"$oid":"5b1cd6179d95680014f7cf3f"},{"$oid":"5b1cd6a69d95680014f7cf42"},{"$oid":"5b1cd6a49d95680014f7cf41"},{"$oid":"5b1cd7609d95680014f7cf43"},{"$oid":"5b1cd7639d95680014f7cf44"},{"$oid":"5b1cd7f69d95680014f7cf45"},{"$oid":"5b1cd8429d95680014f7cf46"},{"$oid":"5b1cd9489d95680014f7cf48"},{"$oid":"5b1cd9719d95680014f7cf49"},{"$oid":"5b1cd9b69d95680014f7cf4a"},{"$oid":"5b1cda3e9d95680014f7cf4b"},{"$oid":"5b1cdaf99d95680014f7cf4c"},{"$oid":"5b1cdc889d95680014f7cf4f"},{"$oid":"5b1cdddd9d95680014f7cf51"},{"$oid":"5b1cf011eaf1f300145a5919"},{"$oid":"5b1cf9b1eaf1f300145a591c"},{"$oid":"5b1cfb9eeaf1f300145a591e"}],"speaker_ids":[{"$oid":"5af7ef87d0210a0014a8c6f8"}],"__v":0}

Without a correct model for working with time BAD THINGS HAPPEN: data is persisted out of order, exceptions occur where they shouldn't be possible, and production systems blow up.\n\nWe'll cover the various common representations of time, acknowledge their caveats and deficiencies, and hopefully learn a few new tools and practices along the way.","outline":"Full slide deck at https://www.slideshare.net/holograph/how-shit-works-time","legal":true,"created_at":{"$date":"2018-05-23T16:54:27.589Z"},"updated_at":{"$date":"2018-05-29T14:28:02.961Z"},"status":"accepted","categories":["Programming","Backend"],"tags":["architecture","distributed systems"],"comments":[],"attendees":[{"$oid":"5af3d82edb27ea0014a6f7bf"},{"$oid":"5b0f0d66892ac300148168c0"},{"$oid":"5b113662bba1a90014b9c0c8"},{"$oid":"5b11401cbba1a90014b9c0d9"},{"$oid":"5b0baa5592ac8b0014779700"},{"$oid":"5ae57b869415100014cf757a"},{"$oid":"5b114f23bba1a90014b9c0e9"},{"$oid":"5b115334bba1a90014b9c0ed"},{"$oid":"5aed91ab8ef0e50014913278"},{"$oid":"5b117474bba1a90014b9c116"},{"$oid":"5b117c13bba1a90014b9c119"},{"$oid":"5afecbbf6da2a500140d89a1"},{"$oid":"5af011e50c482c0014ab5145"},{"$oid":"5b0a4a1636e9e10014ced47f"},{"$oid":"5b117e5ebba1a90014b9c11d"},{"$oid":"5b122b6537bc6300142f6945"},{"$oid":"5b117e9ebba1a90014b9c11e"},{"$oid":"5b0ba65092ac8b00147796fc"},{"$oid":"5b126cfb38213e0014d1d027"},{"$oid":"5b128c2838213e0014d1d03d"},{"$oid":"5b12c9c938213e0014d1d06d"},{"$oid":"5b12ca5738213e0014d1d06e"},{"$oid":"5b13067f38213e0014d1d0ac"},{"$oid":"5acc6333fe5562001493c9e2"},{"$oid":"5b0bac8d92ac8b0014779702"},{"$oid":"5afd20766555a80014e7e0a4"},{"$oid":"5b1231a837bc6300142f6947"},{"$oid":"5af1e2814ff5eb00144ee545"},{"$oid":"5b12af8e38213e0014d1d059"},{"$oid":"5b1398e67763d60014e5e9fd"},{"$oid":"5b02847c5d1a1000140c59b5"},{"$oid":"5b13a4422f70680014eee82c"},{"$oid":"5b13a3bb2f70680014eee829"},{"$oid":"5b13a9022f70680014eee84a"},{"$oid":"5b0b9a0192ac8b00147796fa"},{"$oid":"5b13b31869fe6400146c2478"},{"$oid":"5af94ca0b5d55a001446ce84"},{"$oid":"5b0263c75d1a1000140c59b1"},{"$oid":"5b13c4ad69fe6400146c24d2"},{"$oid":"5b13d51269fe6400146c2541"},{"$oid":"5b13da5669fe6400146c2554"},{"$oid":"5b13fa0269fe6400146c25b6"},{"$oid":"5b141cb569fe6400146c25ef"},{"$oid":"5b12bb7638213e0014d1d064"},{"$oid":"5b11b82837bc6300142f6933"},{"$oid":"5b14c97f69fe6400146c263a"},{"$oid":"5b14e5cc69fe6400146c266c"},{"$oid":"5b150f0ac6fa1800145b0800"},{"$oid":"5b1557d8c6fa1800145b0896"},{"$oid":"5b13a9ee69fe6400146c2446"},{"$oid":"5b17a7d7c740cb0014f8a942"},{"$oid":"5b0c36076c37af00145dbe29"},{"$oid":"5b0efa652743a60014eeb41b"},{"$oid":"5b1a23462cd4b700143921aa"},{"$oid":"5b115ddcbba1a90014b9c0f2"},{"$oid":"5b1bc8339d95680014f7cf0d"},{"$oid":"5b1bfe5a9d95680014f7cf12"},{"$oid":"5afda8ba6555a80014e7e0af"}],"speaker_ids":[{"$oid":"5b0263c75d1a1000140c59b1"}],"__v":0}

I also explain that the reason we can cover all this in just 40 minutes is because all these tools are based on a plugin-based architecture, and because even though they solve different problems the code is relatively similar.\n* 4m ASTs concepts: Explain the concept of ASTs with an example of a short JS snippet and seeing its matching AST represenation. Explain the steps of parsing code into an AST, modifying it, and generating JS from it. Show the tool astexplorer.net which let's you very quickly check the AST representation of any JS code you enter which is helpful to get started.\n* 6m 1st real-world problem we're going to solve: Enforce your team's code-conventions. Share my experience using ESLint (shortly explain what a linter is, and say that ESLint is currently the most popular) and how one of their built-in linting rules didn't work the way I expected (show the the buggy code it didn't catch). Say that I was able to solve this problem myself by writing my own linting rule. Show the code of the new rule (few lines of code) and show how after it's used ESLint is able to find the buggy code.\n* 1m Segway: Explain how ESLint doesn't generate JS, it just parses existing JS. Next we'll look at a tool that does generate JS. In fact, we'll look at the most popular one there is: Babel.\n* 4m 2nd problem we're going to solve: Reducing writing boilerplate code with Babel. Very shortly explain what Babel is. Give an example of how it works by works by showing the code of one of its internal plugins. Since most people are only aware of the built-in Babel plugins, give some useful examples of 3rd-party plugins that people wrote to give the audience ideas.\n* 1m Segway: Explain how Babel has it easy because it's used to generate throw-away code that is re-generated on every deployment. Next we'll look at a tool that generates actual source-code that you commit under your name in your source-control!\n* 6m 3rd problem we're going to solve: Large-scale refactoring with ease. What happens if need to refactor a very large codebase, for example to upgrade from ES5 to ES6. It can be very tedious and time-consuming. We'll look at an alternative approach using a \"code-mod\" (\"code modification tool\") using a library open-sourced by Facebook called \"jscodeshift\". I show the (short) code of a code-mod that upgrades \"var\" statements to \"let\". Then I address \"the elephant in the room\" which is \"do you really trust a machine to write error-free \u0026 beautiful code for you\". I give best-practices to how to choose and how to write \"code-mods\" that you would actually feel confident running on your code.\n* 2m Wrap-up: Show end slide with link to github page which aggregates more info on what I've shown.\n* 3m Open for questions","legal":true,"created_at":{"$date":"2018-05-24T08:40:54.036Z"},"updated_at":{"$date":"2018-05-24T08:40:54.036Z"},"status":"accepted","categories":["Quality","Frontend"],"tags":["javascript","tools","asts"],"comments":[],"attendees":[{"$oid":"5af3d82edb27ea0014a6f7bf"},{"$oid":"5b103099892ac30014816945"},{"$oid":"5ae0c3c865b29100146c5969"},{"$oid":"5b121e7937bc6300142f693e"},{"$oid":"5acc6333fe5562001493c9e2"},{"$oid":"5b12f10638213e0014d1d09f"},{"$oid":"5b1372d638213e0014d1d0b7"},{"$oid":"5b137e7538213e0014d1d0c7"},{"$oid":"5b138f3338213e0014d1d10c"},{"$oid":"5b0f9857892ac300148168d7"},{"$oid":"5ae0ed9f65b29100146c596e"},{"$oid":"5b13a7ed2f70680014eee83f"},{"$oid":"5b13de7c69fe6400146c256b"},{"$oid":"5b13deb969fe6400146c256d"},{"$oid":"5b115334bba1a90014b9c0ed"},{"$oid":"5b13f39969fe6400146c25ab"},{"$oid":"5ae1c8e130c592001426af8c"},{"$oid":"5b141cb569fe6400146c25ef"},{"$oid":"5b1422f269fe6400146c25f3"},{"$oid":"5b150b45c6fa1800145b07f6"},{"$oid":"5b18c8958f4d6f001461278e"}],"speaker_ids":[{"$oid":"5b066be46c8bb70014163786"}],"__v":0}

While doing so, a pattern emerged - almost each set of changes would reduce the code line count, and yet the functionality stayed exactly the same.\n\nThis presentation explains how and why we cut 40% of the code with no functionality loss without trying.","outline":"- Introduction: who I am, what I do (2 min)\n- Overview: refactoring for upstream, expected result, what we ended up getting (4 min)\n- The deadly sins - list of \"meta bugs\" we fixed, with detail on each to follow (2 min)\n- Reinventing the wheel - implementing things the framework already has and how to avoid doing that (2 min)\n- Backwards compatibility - how to handle it wrong causing much code duplication and how to do it right (6 min)\n- Using the wrong API - how bad choice of framework API can lead to writing much more code (2 min)\n- Duct tape engineering - how trying to work around problems in the framework leads to bloat (fix the framework instead) (2 min)\n- The HAl/PAL fallacy - how trying to be platform agnostics backfires (2 min)\n- Zombie code - the surprising amount of code and data structures in your code that are never used (2 min) \n- Don't repeat yourself - how what you learned in programming 101 actually does matter (2 min)\n- Happy end (2 min) - what ended up happening\n- Wrap up (2 minutes)","legal":true,"created_at":{"$date":"2018-05-28T13:35:19.568Z"},"updated_at":{"$date":"2018-05-28T13:42:25.208Z"},"status":"accepted","categories":["Quality","Programming"],"tags":["Coding-Practices","optimization","open source"],"comments":[],"attendees":[{"$oid":"5adc3c179bd58800140f1dee"},{"$oid":"5b113662bba1a90014b9c0c8"},{"$oid":"5b0fcd65892ac300148168ff"},{"$oid":"5b113dafbba1a90014b9c0d7"},{"$oid":"5aeaa00d65b6d50014d069bc"},{"$oid":"5b119ee5bba1a90014b9c12c"},{"$oid":"5b12105237bc6300142f693d"},{"$oid":"5b117e9ebba1a90014b9c11e"},{"$oid":"5ae1a93a30c592001426af87"},{"$oid":"5b128c2838213e0014d1d03d"},{"$oid":"5b12ddce38213e0014d1d08d"},{"$oid":"5afd06916555a80014e7e0a2"},{"$oid":"5b116c38bba1a90014b9c109"},{"$oid":"5b13901f7763d60014e5e9cd"},{"$oid":"5b138f3338213e0014d1d10c"},{"$oid":"5b0263c75d1a1000140c59b1"},{"$oid":"5b13c11269fe6400146c24bc"},{"$oid":"5b13cbf369fe6400146c2510"},{"$oid":"5ae1c8e130c592001426af8c"},{"$oid":"5afa812984356a0014d61b17"},{"$oid":"5ae57b869415100014cf757a"},{"$oid":"5b0283305d1a1000140c59b4"},{"$oid":"5ae15edd65b29100146c5979"},{"$oid":"5b163fc0c6fa1800145b092b"},{"$oid":"5b13dbf269fe6400146c255d"},{"$oid":"5b18ba068f4d6f0014612785"}],"speaker_ids":[{"$oid":"5ae57b869415100014cf757a"}],"__v":0}

However, quite often we find ourselves investing too much time and effort in the development of the MVP. Precious time that sometimes goes to waste. There are different techniques to minimize the required effort of the MVP like “Fake Door”, “Concierge MVP” and others that allow you to get user’s verification and invest as little as possible in the development.

This might cause long development cycles and production issues. In many cases, applications can be accelerated dramatically if some approximation is allowed. The idea is to find a sample of the data, that enables fast processing on one hand, but achieves good result accuracy on the other hand.

I want to look at this issue from a purely utilitarian perspective: companies want to hire \u0026 retain the most talented developers out there. Obviously, many of them are women and we want to hire \u0026 retain them just the same. Addressing that challenge may require taking approaches different from the ones we’re used to.\n\nI will share the process we went through, which led to a wider look at our culture and the messages we convey outside, and even more within the organization. I will also share some practical ideas on how you can make a change in your organization.","outline":"3m -  Intro on myself and Soluto, and an intro to this talk: this is not a talk about D\u0026I (diversity and inclusion), because this is a talk on hiring and retaining the best talent possible.\n3m - Diversity fatigue and a quick recap of the state of D\u0026I in the industry (https://www.atlassian.com/diversity/survey/2018).\n4m - Why diversity fatigue is a result of focusing on D\u0026I mainly as a social problem. Instead, I would like to offer a more utilitarian way of looking at it - as an opportunity.\n4m - By reducing our alignment to traditional/obvious audiences, we can reach potential talent where we have an advantage. Aligning ourselves to different audiences means we have to take a broad look at our culture and actions.\n5m - How we started an ongoing process within Soluto: got more people involved, especially women and pushed their ideas. As part of this process, we realized this touches many different aspects of the work at Soluto, as well as the messages we convey. For example, how managers communicate with employees, what company events look like, how we interview, and more.\n4m - Getting started yourself: remember diversity fatigue; Instead of setting quotas, ask yourself “am I doing everything I can to get that/retain talent?”; Get more people involved; Ask questions directly, for example: “is this a safe environment for you to work?”.\n4m - Q\u0026A\n\nTotal time: 27 min","legal":true,"created_at":{"$date":"2018-05-30T13:40:51.647Z"},"updated_at":{"$date":"2018-05-31T18:48:29.826Z"},"status":"proposed","categories":["Culture"],"tags":["Hiring","Culture","Diversity"],"comments":[],"attendees":[{"$oid":"5b113662bba1a90014b9c0c8"},{"$oid":"5b113ca8bba1a90014b9c0d4"},{"$oid":"5b11348dbba1a90014b9c0c6"},{"$oid":"5af86b69b5d55a001446ce79"},{"$oid":"5b114d8cbba1a90014b9c0e7"},{"$oid":"5b0fef33892ac30014816915"},{"$oid":"5b114f23bba1a90014b9c0e9"},{"$oid":"5b11600cbba1a90014b9c0f7"},{"$oid":"5adc3c179bd58800140f1dee"},{"$oid":"5b117474bba1a90014b9c116"},{"$oid":"5aed91ab8ef0e50014913278"},{"$oid":"5b118a6bbba1a90014b9c126"},{"$oid":"5b118f6cbba1a90014b9c128"},{"$oid":"5ae491a54d69640014d96a80"},{"$oid":"5b113152bba1a90014b9c0be"},{"$oid":"5b116c38bba1a90014b9c109"},{"$oid":"5b027a935d1a1000140c59b3"},{"$oid":"5b03b67b5a9f82001487a3ef"},{"$oid":"5b0e5b082743a60014eeb3da"},{"$oid":"5b1398657763d60014e5e9f8"},{"$oid":"5b13987c7763d60014e5e9fa"},{"$oid":"5b1399067763d60014e5ea00"},{"$oid":"5b1399aa7763d60014e5ea04"},{"$oid":"5b1399b27763d60014e5ea05"},{"$oid":"5b139a4b7763d60014e5ea0a"},{"$oid":"5b139a7b7763d60014e5ea0d"},{"$oid":"5b139af37763d60014e5ea0e"},{"$oid":"5b139b0b7763d60014e5ea0f"},{"$oid":"5b139b877763d60014e5ea15"},{"$oid":"5b139d172f70680014eee806"},{"$oid":"5b139dd62f70680014eee80d"},{"$oid":"5b113826bba1a90014b9c0cb"},{"$oid":"5b139e462f70680014eee812"},{"$oid":"5b139fa92f70680014eee818"},{"$oid":"5b13a3642f70680014eee825"},{"$oid":"5b13a70f2f70680014eee839"},{"$oid":"5b13be9a69fe6400146c24b2"},{"$oid":"5b13c05269fe6400146c24b7"},{"$oid":"5b13ce4869fe6400146c2521"},{"$oid":"5b0fb78c892ac300148168f3"},{"$oid":"5b13d76169fe6400146c2546"},{"$oid":"5b13dcee69fe6400146c2564"},{"$oid":"5b0283305d1a1000140c59b4"},{"$oid":"5b11b82837bc6300142f6933"},{"$oid":"5b12ddce38213e0014d1d08d"},{"$oid":"5b14c24269fe6400146c2636"},{"$oid":"5af8725fb5d55a001446ce7a"},{"$oid":"5b150180c6fa1800145b07d8"},{"$oid":"5b15022ac6fa1800145b07dc"},{"$oid":"5b15019bc6fa1800145b07d9"},{"$oid":"5b1512fcc6fa1800145b0808"},{"$oid":"5b150d63c6fa1800145b07fd"},{"$oid":"5b146c0f69fe6400146c262c"},{"$oid":"5afa812984356a0014d61b17"},{"$oid":"5b0fae29892ac300148168e7"},{"$oid":"5b16648ac740cb0014f8a8c3"},{"$oid":"5b166681c740cb0014f8a8c4"},{"$oid":"5b1407ad69fe6400146c25dd"},{"$oid":"5b16c8cfc740cb0014f8a8f2"},{"$oid":"5b16cbb9c740cb0014f8a8f5"},{"$oid":"5b16cb47c740cb0014f8a8f4"},{"$oid":"5b1790cac740cb0014f8a92d"},{"$oid":"5acc6333fe5562001493c9e2"},{"$oid":"5b17db988f4d6f00146126f5"},{"$oid":"5b18ed018f4d6f00146127b9"},{"$oid":"5b1929152cd4b70014392180"},{"$oid":"5b1bfe5a9d95680014f7cf12"},{"$oid":"5afda8ba6555a80014e7e0af"},{"$oid":"5b1ce6819d95680014f7cf58"},{"$oid":"5b1d869beaf1f300145a5943"}],"speaker_ids":[{"$oid":"5b03b6715a9f82001487a3ee"}],"__v":0}

The structure might be similar, but going through stories instead of mechanized points.\n","legal":true,"created_at":{"$date":"2018-05-30T18:23:44.793Z"},"updated_at":{"$date":"2018-05-30T18:23:44.793Z"},"status":"proposed","categories":["Culture"],"tags":["Culture","remote","Management"],"comments":[],"attendees":[{"$oid":"5adc3c179bd58800140f1dee"},{"$oid":"5b113662bba1a90014b9c0c8"},{"$oid":"5b11bf5937bc6300142f6937"},{"$oid":"5af023c20c482c0014ab5146"},{"$oid":"5b11e35637bc6300142f693a"},{"$oid":"5b12474338213e0014d1d00d"},{"$oid":"5ae0eea865b29100146c5970"},{"$oid":"5b0ba65092ac8b00147796fc"},{"$oid":"5b128c2838213e0014d1d03d"},{"$oid":"5b12b46538213e0014d1d05c"},{"$oid":"5b12b8f138213e0014d1d061"},{"$oid":"5b103099892ac30014816945"},{"$oid":"5b13863338213e0014d1d0e0"},{"$oid":"5b13875538213e0014d1d0e7"},{"$oid":"5afd20766555a80014e7e0a4"},{"$oid":"5af9c96784356a0014d61b14"},{"$oid":"5b13a4002f70680014eee82b"},{"$oid":"5b13a82a2f70680014eee841"},{"$oid":"5b13c64769fe6400146c24e6"},{"$oid":"5b13cbf369fe6400146c2510"},{"$oid":"5b14e71169fe6400146c2672"},{"$oid":"5b150f0ac6fa1800145b0800"},{"$oid":"5b0da5f44b330d00147e3387"},{"$oid":"5afa812984356a0014d61b17"},{"$oid":"5b12ddce38213e0014d1d08d"},{"$oid":"5b0f6f04892ac300148168cc"},{"$oid":"5b14f6fe69fe6400146c269c"},{"$oid":"5b1a59992cd4b700143921b7"},{"$oid":"5b1a61352cd4b700143921b8"},{"$oid":"5b1a662f238ef1001448aed6"},{"$oid":"5b1a6f88238ef1001448aed7"},{"$oid":"5b1a7050238ef1001448aed8"},{"$oid":"5b1a728f238ef1001448aed9"},{"$oid":"5b1a76dc238ef1001448aedb"},{"$oid":"5b1a770a238ef1001448aedc"},{"$oid":"5b1a7ac3238ef1001448aedd"},{"$oid":"5b1a7e9e238ef1001448aedf"},{"$oid":"5b1a7eed238ef1001448aee0"},{"$oid":"5b1a885c238ef1001448aee1"},{"$oid":"5b1ab156238ef1001448aef4"},{"$oid":"5b1b8360238ef1001448af0b"},{"$oid":"5b1bc8339d95680014f7cf0d"},{"$oid":"5afda8ba6555a80014e7e0af"},{"$oid":"5b1c31239d95680014f7cf14"},{"$oid":"5b1c35e09d95680014f7cf15"},{"$oid":"5b1cdbb19d95680014f7cf4d"}],"speaker_ids":[{"$oid":"5af023c20c482c0014ab5146"}],"__v":0}

Not only will it make us better developers, not only will it make us better “abstraction-users”, but also - it’s something we are all completely capable of.\nSo let’s dive into two such abstractions - ReactJS’s component lifecycle and Angular’s EventEmitter - and look at the source code and the nuts and bolts that make them possible.\n","outline":"3m - introduction - why specializing in abstractions can be problematic (we know and write frameworks - but we can optimize the way we use them by understanding how they work under the hood)\n12m - example 1 - the react lifecycle - what is the javascript code and web APIs that enable it - source code example of 1-2 lifecycle events. \n12m - example 2 - the angular event emitter - how do we create an event emitter in javascript? what are some enhancements angular provides? source code examples\n(for both the examples, level of difficulty can vary)\n3m - conclusion.

Unexpectedly, I found myself fighting to stay afloat on a wild sea of project designs, code reviews and syncs. It took me a while to realize that my focus should be on my time, and on learning how to manage it. I developed a set of techniques that kept me sane, and stopped me from becoming a bottleneck for my team. In this lightning talk I'll share some tips for first time managers, as well as the personal tools I use for time management. If you're managing people or a project and struggle to find time to do everything you want to do, then this talk is for you.","outline":"30s About me and my experience of becoming a manager.\n60s Understanding your management style, and that interactions with your team take time. Work out which of these interactions are important to you, and make sure to set aside time for them.\n60s Taking the time to plan ahead saves time. You can set things up so your team members aren’t constantly waiting for each other or for you. Also, don’t be afraid to spend more time than feels natural to give your team members all the information and context they need to carry out tasks. This makes things less frustrating for them, and makes you less of a bottleneck. \n45s Find tools that work for you to track all your tasks, including the ‘day to day’ management interactions. There are fancy tools out there, but for me a simple daily checklist (and one for each team member) works the best.\n60s You’re on a team too. There are times when it is more efficient for everyone to ask for assistance or ideas from other managers. Your team members ask each other for help all the time. The management team should be the same.a\n30s Recap\n15s Closing thought: Your time is precious, but don’t be afraid to take on new things.

We’ll also go over asyncio syntax, as well as cover the main concepts behind writing asyncio applications, common pitfalls and best practices.","outline":"Introduction to python's asyncio\n\nIntroduction - 2 min\nDefinition of asynchronous - 1 min\nEvent loops vs Threads, pros and cons - 3 min\nPython event loop history: tornado, twisted, gevent - 2 min\nAsyncio syntax - 5 min\nCode examples: (total of 10 min)\n - aiohttp\n - error handling\n - sleeps and retries\nGotchas: (total of 10 min)\n - dont do long works (keep the event loop free) by using asyncio executor for long jobs\n - using aiohttp and not synchronous clients\n - debug/stack trace\n\nQ\u0026A - 5 min\n\nTotal gross time: 38 min","legal":true,"created_at":{"$date":"2018-05-31T07:00:20.761Z"},"updated_at":{"$date":"2018-05-31T07:15:13.583Z"},"status":"proposed","categories":["Programming","Backend"],"tags":["Backend","Programming Languages","Python"],"comments":[],"attendees":[{"$oid":"5b01a121ea92090014a196cd"},{"$oid":"5b0bbe9b6c37af00145dbe0a"},{"$oid":"5ae99d6fad72ec001497f4d6"},{"$oid":"5b11401cbba1a90014b9c0d9"},{"$oid":"5b0d7aab4b330d00147e337f"},{"$oid":"5b103099892ac30014816945"},{"$oid":"5b1169b7bba1a90014b9c106"},{"$oid":"5b119ee5bba1a90014b9c12c"},{"$oid":"5b126dff38213e0014d1d02a"},{"$oid":"5b128c2838213e0014d1d03d"},{"$oid":"5b12b46538213e0014d1d05c"},{"$oid":"5b113335bba1a90014b9c0c2"},{"$oid":"5b12e31e38213e0014d1d092"},{"$oid":"5b12e80038213e0014d1d099"},{"$oid":"5b13083438213e0014d1d0ad"},{"$oid":"5b1311bc38213e0014d1d0ae"},{"$oid":"5b1387e338213e0014d1d0eb"},{"$oid":"5b138a0b38213e0014d1d0ee"},{"$oid":"5b1393537763d60014e5e9e0"},{"$oid":"5b1393227763d60014e5e9de"},{"$oid":"5b13939e7763d60014e5e9e2"},{"$oid":"5b1394237763d60014e5e9e7"},{"$oid":"5b11b82837bc6300142f6933"},{"$oid":"5b139a117763d60014e5ea07"},{"$oid":"5b139a3e7763d60014e5ea09"},{"$oid":"5b13a5522f70680014eee82f"},{"$oid":"5b0ff4cd892ac30014816917"},{"$oid":"5b13aa1f69fe6400146c2448"},{"$oid":"5b13ab8869fe6400146c2453"},{"$oid":"5b13ab8169fe6400146c2452"},{"$oid":"5b137d6f38213e0014d1d0c1"},{"$oid":"5b0efa652743a60014eeb41b"},{"$oid":"5b097ecd36e9e10014ced478"},{"$oid":"5b13c62869fe6400146c24e4"},{"$oid":"5b13d8fd69fe6400146c254f"},{"$oid":"5b13e51669fe6400146c258b"},{"$oid":"5b13e47e69fe6400146c2586"},{"$oid":"5b0541d786df020014dfa095"},{"$oid":"5b14d76b69fe6400146c264a"},{"$oid":"5b14d7b569fe6400146c264b"},{"$oid":"5b14e03369fe6400146c265a"},{"$oid":"5b14e52569fe6400146c266a"},{"$oid":"5b14eccc69fe6400146c2684"},{"$oid":"5b14eeaf69fe6400146c268c"},{"$oid":"5b06d3446c8bb70014163795"},{"$oid":"5b14f12269fe6400146c2691"},{"$oid":"5b14f1bf69fe6400146c2692"},{"$oid":"5b1505fbc6fa1800145b07e3"},{"$oid":"5b14f71769fe6400146c269e"},{"$oid":"5b153fb6c6fa1800145b0866"},{"$oid":"5b15426ec6fa1800145b0868"},{"$oid":"5b160bfbc6fa1800145b0902"},{"$oid":"5b161c31c6fa1800145b0904"},{"$oid":"5b166dc7c740cb0014f8a8d2"},{"$oid":"5b04571a5a9f82001487a3fb"},{"$oid":"5b18f7028f4d6f00146127c1"},{"$oid":"5b18c8958f4d6f001461278e"},{"$oid":"5b14dfb669fe6400146c2658"},{"$oid":"5b1a4ea12cd4b700143921b4"},{"$oid":"5b1bc8339d95680014f7cf0d"},{"$oid":"5b067df16c8bb7001416378c"},{"$oid":"5b1d8984eaf1f300145a5945"}],"speaker_ids":[{"$oid":"5b06d3446c8bb70014163795"}],"__v":0}

It can free the developers to do what they do best – develop great software – but without compromising their security.\n \nIn this session I will introduce Conjur Open Source, walk through how native and easy security can become and how you can get started and contribute – right after this session.\n","outline":"1m Introduction: Who am I and my professional background \n\n2m Security last but not least problem \n\n2m Devops \u0026 Security \n\n4m Conjur Open Source introduction Security should be natively and seamlessly  \n\n1m Q\u0026A ","legal":true,"created_at":{"$date":"2018-05-31T11:02:39.617Z"},"updated_at":{"$date":"2018-08-04T21:35:22.480Z"},"status":"accepted","categories":["Backend"],"tags":["DevOps","Security","open source"],"comments":[],"attendees":[{"$oid":"5adc3c179bd58800140f1dee"},{"$oid":"5b0f9c75892ac300148168db"},{"$oid":"5b110ef69537c7001464801d"},{"$oid":"5b11137d9537c70014648020"},{"$oid":"5b1119249537c70014648025"},{"$oid":"5b111c61bba1a90014b9c0af"},{"$oid":"5b112640bba1a90014b9c0b6"},{"$oid":"5b1129e5bba1a90014b9c0b9"},{"$oid":"5b113662bba1a90014b9c0c8"},{"$oid":"5b0bae7992ac8b0014779705"},{"$oid":"5b115334bba1a90014b9c0ed"},{"$oid":"5b113c29bba1a90014b9c0d2"},{"$oid":"5b113dafbba1a90014b9c0d7"},{"$oid":"5b116b84bba1a90014b9c108"},{"$oid":"5ae0c3c865b29100146c5969"},{"$oid":"5b117e9ebba1a90014b9c11e"},{"$oid":"5b12d84738213e0014d1d080"},{"$oid":"5b12db6838213e0014d1d088"},{"$oid":"5b0bac8d92ac8b0014779702"},{"$oid":"5b13a4f12f70680014eee82e"},{"$oid":"5b1396fa7763d60014e5e9ec"},{"$oid":"5b13aa4269fe6400146c244a"},{"$oid":"5b13b75e69fe6400146c2488"},{"$oid":"5b13ba7969fe6400146c2492"},{"$oid":"5b13fabd69fe6400146c25b9"},{"$oid":"5b1181dbbba1a90014b9c120"},{"$oid":"5b142f1369fe6400146c2600"},{"$oid":"5b0ead902743a60014eeb405"},{"$oid":"5b14e71169fe6400146c2672"},{"$oid":"5b14f6e169fe6400146c269b"},{"$oid":"5b0fb1be892ac300148168ec"},{"$oid":"5b14fc1e69fe6400146c26b8"},{"$oid":"5b150f0ac6fa1800145b0800"},{"$oid":"5b0acc2792ac8b00147796ef"},{"$oid":"5b151dc8c6fa1800145b0825"},{"$oid":"5b146c0f69fe6400146c262c"},{"$oid":"5b153964c6fa1800145b085e"},{"$oid":"5afa812984356a0014d61b17"},{"$oid":"5b158edcc6fa1800145b08c7"},{"$oid":"5b163463c6fa1800145b0915"},{"$oid":"5b0f85d5892ac300148168d0"},{"$oid":"5b16bff4c740cb0014f8a8ef"},{"$oid":"5b0faf73892ac300148168e9"},{"$oid":"5b176771c740cb0014f8a919"},{"$oid":"5b1773d5c740cb0014f8a91c"},{"$oid":"5b17738bc740cb0014f8a91b"},{"$oid":"5b17782cc740cb0014f8a920"},{"$oid":"5b177decc740cb0014f8a924"},{"$oid":"5b17804ec740cb0014f8a928"},{"$oid":"5b178358c740cb0014f8a92a"},{"$oid":"5b16ade8c740cb0014f8a8ea"},{"$oid":"5b178b96c740cb0014f8a92c"},{"$oid":"5b1798c3c740cb0014f8a931"},{"$oid":"5b177488c740cb0014f8a91e"},{"$oid":"5b17abc4c740cb0014f8a944"},{"$oid":"5acc6333fe5562001493c9e2"},{"$oid":"5b1831348f4d6f0014612764"},{"$oid":"5b18b4ef8f4d6f0014612782"},{"$oid":"5b18eb488f4d6f00146127b5"},{"$oid":"5b18c8958f4d6f001461278e"},{"$oid":"5b1133a0bba1a90014b9c0c4"},{"$oid":"5b12ddce38213e0014d1d08d"},{"$oid":"5afda8ba6555a80014e7e0af"},{"$oid":"5b0fc9d9892ac300148168fa"},{"$oid":"5b1cb50e9d95680014f7cf27"},{"$oid":"5b1d3bc8eaf1f300145a5929"},{"$oid":"5b13cb9469fe6400146c250d"},{"$oid":"5b1d3efdeaf1f300145a592a"},{"$oid":"5b1d44caeaf1f300145a592c"},{"$oid":"5b1d6a94eaf1f300145a593a"},{"$oid":"5b1d777ceaf1f300145a593d"}],"speaker_ids":[{"$oid":"5b0fcd65892ac300148168ff"}],"__v":0}

You should have a simple micro-services design, do TDD while pairing, deploy 42 times an hour with 4 variants of A/B tests, and always eat your vegetables. However, real life pragmatic considerations will lead every organization to make compromises. Whether you’re a startup going quick and dirty in order to survive or an established company that maintains some older code, you may get to a point where you must improve your testing or even start it from scratch, while moving forward and adding features. In this session I will explain how it can be achieved, sharing hard learnt lessons on practical automatic testing strategies while on the run.","outline":"The idea for this lecture came from a discussion I’ve had with a friends about their CI/CD and changes they’re trying to make in order to improve it. In Ravello such major change happened a few years ago, and for me the sign of success for our change is that juniors joining the team avoid using the UI for testing their features because \"it waists so much time”. Compared to automation and UT writing, of course.\nThis talk is not about pure best practices, on which you can find tones of information, but about making a successful change that will allow you to gradually adopt best practices while continuing to develop the product.\n\n- 1M: Self presentation\n- 2M: Topic presentaiton: \n\u0009Problem: in real live dev environments, you sometimes get to a point you realize you must significantly improve your testing in order to proceed. Usually the pains is either stability (constant chaise after production analysis and hot fixes) or long release cycles and/or lots of resources invested in it.\n\u0009Solution: tests, duh.\n\u0009The problem is that although there’s tons of literature about creating a perfectly tested code base, no one addresses the challenge of converting not such a perfectly tested (startups gotta run fast, legacy code, etc.) already existing and deployed in production code base to one.\n\u0009We did that in Ravello and I’m going to share how it can be achieved without halting feature delivery, discussing the process, pitfalls and also supplying some practical tips.\n- 1M: The challenge is to improve coverage while moving forward, and therefor it’s crucial to minimise the time invested in the project.

Recommendation (+ reasoning): UTs for corner cases and minor e2e coverage for העברת חוטר.\n- 7M: Minimizing maintenance time\n\u0009- 5M: Step 1: reorg: recommendation: automation (e2e) done by the developer (and not in a designated team)\n\u0009\u0009- 3M: Reasons (quality ownership, avoiding bottleneck, context switches, knowledge share issues, each dev team has its own tailor-made test infra..)\n\u0009\u0009- 2M: Achieving such change successfully (getting team cooperation, putting your best man on the job, investing in infra, etc.)\n\u0009- 2M: Step 2: infra and specifically code sharing - tests call for code duplication more than “regular” code, due to mutual setup that slightly changes in each test. Fight it using a correct design:\n\u0009\u0009- UTs - default mocks for complex data model, verify and stub methods shared within a class.\n\u0009\u0009- e2e - aspect oriented programming, layers: clients (SDKs), business logic (services) and tests - each layer only orchestrates the calls of the layer before.\n- 10M: Miminze test analysis\n\u0009- 1M: Don’t be afraid to delete old tests - stability is important.\n\u0009- 2M: Test history - helps understanding why these tests fail often and crucial when building tests infra gradually (+ show our infra).\n\u0009- 7M: General tips: e2e, UT.\n- 2M: Summary and some words about what this \"first steps\" program does not contain and where can it move on to.\n- 4M: Q\u0026A","legal":true,"created_at":{"$date":"2018-05-31T15:25:40.651Z"},"updated_at":{"$date":"2018-05-31T15:25:40.651Z"},"status":"proposed","categories":["Quality"],"tags":["Testing","Culture"],"comments":[],"attendees":[{"$oid":"5b11348dbba1a90014b9c0c6"},{"$oid":"5ae99d6fad72ec001497f4d6"},{"$oid":"5b113662bba1a90014b9c0c8"},{"$oid":"5b114843bba1a90014b9c0e3"},{"$oid":"5ae57b869415100014cf757a"},{"$oid":"5b1164edbba1a90014b9c0fc"},{"$oid":"5adc3c179bd58800140f1dee"},{"$oid":"5b117474bba1a90014b9c116"},{"$oid":"5ae0c3c865b29100146c5969"},{"$oid":"5b11839fbba1a90014b9c122"},{"$oid":"5af011e50c482c0014ab5145"},{"$oid":"5b102b0d892ac30014816943"},{"$oid":"5b11cfe337bc6300142f6938"},{"$oid":"5b116cfabba1a90014b9c10b"},{"$oid":"5b122b6537bc6300142f6945"},{"$oid":"5b124ae738213e0014d1d00e"},{"$oid":"5b117e9ebba1a90014b9c11e"},{"$oid":"5aed91ab8ef0e50014913278"},{"$oid":"5b123c6e38213e0014d1d009"},{"$oid":"5b11324bbba1a90014b9c0bf"},{"$oid":"5b12713e38213e0014d1d02d"},{"$oid":"5b127e4438213e0014d1d037"},{"$oid":"5b0ce8956c37af00145dbe3d"},{"$oid":"5b129e8238213e0014d1d048"},{"$oid":"5b12c92338213e0014d1d06c"},{"$oid":"5b138c4238213e0014d1d0fc"},{"$oid":"5b13a9022f70680014eee84a"},{"$oid":"5b0d38964b330d00147e336e"},{"$oid":"5b104191892ac30014816954"},{"$oid":"5b13d38f69fe6400146c253a"},{"$oid":"5b13d82269fe6400146c254b"},{"$oid":"5b13cbf369fe6400146c2510"},{"$oid":"5b13fd3669fe6400146c25c2"},{"$oid":"5acc6333fe5562001493c9e2"},{"$oid":"5b14397869fe6400146c260a"},{"$oid":"5aeaa00d65b6d50014d069bc"},{"$oid":"5b14551969fe6400146c261f"},{"$oid":"5b14d80769fe6400146c264c"},{"$oid":"5b150f0ac6fa1800145b0800"},{"$oid":"5b146c0f69fe6400146c262c"},{"$oid":"5b01b677ea92090014a196cf"},{"$oid":"5afa812984356a0014d61b17"},{"$oid":"5b166681c740cb0014f8a8c4"},{"$oid":"5b12ddce38213e0014d1d08d"},{"$oid":"5b169dcdc740cb0014f8a8e2"},{"$oid":"5b16927cc740cb0014f8a8de"},{"$oid":"5b129b5e38213e0014d1d045"},{"$oid":"5b14f1df69fe6400146c2693"},{"$oid":"5b18f7028f4d6f00146127c1"},{"$oid":"5ae8326af397710014af8df5"},{"$oid":"5b1a55912cd4b700143921b6"},{"$oid":"5b11b82837bc6300142f6933"}],"speaker_ids":[{"$oid":"5ae2017830c592001426af8d"}],"__v":0}

However, if you've worked with them for a long enough time you've found a few places where the magic starts to break down and the fact that it's actually a collection of several hundred garden gnomes* rather than a single large garden gnome.\n\nThis talk will use Apache Spark, Beam, Flink, Kafka, and Map Reduce to explore the world of data parallel distributed systems. We'll start with some happy pieces of magic, like how we can combine different transformations into a single pass over the data, working between different languages, data partitioning, and lambda serialization. After each new piece of magic is introduced we'll look at how it breaks in one (or two) of the systems.\n\nCome to be told it's not your fault everything is broken, or if your distributed software still works an exciting preview of everything that's going to go wrong. Don't work with distributed systems? Come to be reassured you've made good life choices.","outline":"","legal":true,"created_at":{"$date":"2018-07-31T18:48:09.872Z"},"updated_at":{"$date":"2018-07-31T18:48:09.872Z"},"status":"accepted","categories":[],"tags":[],"comments":[],"attendees":[],"speaker_ids":[{"$oid":"5b60af7eb5c7a00014aaff91"}]}
